## About

This project uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com). An open source web framework for building modern real-time applications.

## Getting Started

Getting up and running is as easy as 1, 2, 3.

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

    ```

## Testing

Simply run `npm test` and all your tests in the `test/` directory will be run.

## Scripts

`npm run db:sync` - drops all tables, then recreates updated tables from model definitions.

`npx sequelize db:seed:all` - fills tables with sample data.

`npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name users` - generates sample seed file. See https://sequelize.org/master/manual/migrations.html for details.

## Scaffolding

Feathers has a powerful command line interface. Here are a few things it can do:

```
$ npm install -g @feathersjs/cli          # Install Feathers CLI

$ feathers generate service               # Generate a new Service
$ feathers generate hook                  # Generate a new Hook
